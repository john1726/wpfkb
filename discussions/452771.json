Thus the keys of type InstantaneousModifierKey does not work as expected, and the keys does not maintain proper state. Is there any other option to use in .NET Framework 4.0 and 4.5 instesd of using IsKeyDownAsync.<br />\n<br />\nRegards<br />\nAvik Sen<br />\n",

You could try using the newer version of InputSimulator that actually drives the WPF keyboard and see if it is more compatible.\r\n<div><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>Cheers,</div>\r\n<div>Mike</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div></div>\r\n</div>\r\n",
