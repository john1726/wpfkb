I call the Window with ShowDialog(). When the User press the Enter-button, i send the information through WCF and then i want to close the window, but the Window appears again and again and again ... I tried window.close() and Dialogresult = true inside the control and also inside the window.\r<br />\n<br />\nIs there anyone who could help me ?\r<br />\n<br />\nMany thanks in advance,\r<br />\nCaipi<br />\n",
