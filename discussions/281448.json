    "Html": "Hi Chianco,\r\n<div><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>You would need to pull down the source for the WPF Keyboard and make some changes. Firstly you'd need to show the four keyboards on the screen which shouldn't be hard at all. Next you'll need to replace where the InputSimulator is used since this simulates\r\n system-wide input events and will enter text into the textbox that currently has focus. Instead of using InputSimulator, just target the text directly into the textbox appropriate for that keyboard.</div>\r\n<div><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>Kind Regards,</div>\r\n<div>Mike<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div>On Thu, Dec 1, 2011 at 11:48 PM, Chianco <span dir=\"ltr\">&lt;<a href=\"mailto:notifications@codeplex.com\">notifications@codeplex.com</a>&gt;</span> wrote:<br>\r\n<blockquote style=\"margin:0 0 0 .8ex; border-left:1px #ccc solid; padding-left:1ex\">\r\n<div>\r\n<p>From: Chianco</p>\r\n<div>\r\n<p>Hi all,<br>\r\nI have to write a WPF application that provides for the simultaneous writing of 4 people, each in its own surfacetextbox.<br>\r\nIs it possible to activate more than one keyboard simultaneously and each writes in his surfacetextbox?<br>\r\n<span>What is the</span> <span>exact row</span> <span>on which</span> <span>to change?</span></p>\r\n<p>Tnk,<br>\r\nChianco </p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n<p>Read the <a href=\"http://wpfkb.codeplex.com/discussions/281448#post705831\" target=\"_blank\">\r\nfull discussion online</a>.</p>\r\n<p>To add a post to this discussion, reply to this email (<a href=\"mailto:wpfkb@discussions.codeplex.com?subject=[wpfkb:281448]\" target=\"_blank\">wpfkb@discussions.codeplex.com</a>)</p>\r\n<p>To start a new discussion for this project, email <a href=\"mailto:wpfkb@discussions.codeplex.com\" target=\"_blank\">\r\nwpfkb@discussions.codeplex.com</a></p>\r\n<p>You are receiving this email because you subscribed to this discussion on CodePlex.
