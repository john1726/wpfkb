The best example I can think of is to download the source code and take a look at how the OnScreenKeypad (or any of the keyboards) are built. The implementation is purely in code, it isn't a very markup-friendly control\r\n set, but it is somewhat pragmatic and very easy to roll your own keyboard from code. Let me know if you get stuck.</div>\r\n<div></div>\r\n<div>Mike<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>On Sat, Dec 18, 2010 at 11:27 PM, exorgroup <span dir=\"ltr\">&lt;<a href=\"mailto:notifications@codeplex.com\">notifications@codeplex.com</a>&gt;</span> wrote:<br>\r\n<blockquote style=\"border-left:#ccc 1px solid; margin:0px 0px 0px 0.8ex; padding-left:1ex\">\r\n<div>\r\n<p>From: exorgroup</p>\r\n<div>\r\n<p>Hi Nice control - used it in 2 project so far and works great</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>I am wondering what UniformOnScreenKeyboard, OnScreenKeyboardSection and OnScreenKey are for?
